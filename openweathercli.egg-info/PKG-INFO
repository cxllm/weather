Description: # Weather CLI
        
        This is a small weather CLI I made in python using the OpenWeatherMap API
        
        ## Examples

        This also works with separate states (with the `--state` argument), but I couldn't think of any examples to use this with
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        sudo pip install openweathercli
        ```
        
        ## Removal
        
        ```
        sudo pip uninstall openweathercli
        ```
        
        ## OpenWeatherMap API key
        
        Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and press ![Sign In](https://i.imgur.com/QHhnmBt.png)
        Then, once you have signed back in (or created an account), you will see an interface such as this one ![Home](https://i.imgur.com/466g5WO.png)
        Along the top, press API Keys ![API Keys](https://i.imgur.com/e64Rklj.png)
        And generate a new key like this (unless you want to use an existing API key)![New Key](https://i.imgur.com/84cPe0i.png)
        Then a new key will be generated and there will be a box that looks somewhat like this ![Key](https://i.imgur.com/ezVKM62.png)
        Copy the text within the box, and then run the script. When you run it for the first time, it will prompt you like this:
